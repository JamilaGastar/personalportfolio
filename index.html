       <div id="about_me_body">
        <p>Welcome!
          <br>
          <br>My name is Jamila, a software development student at Academy Xi based in Melbourne, Australia. 
          <br>
          <br>I have over 8 years' experience in customer service based roles across the corporate and retail industries, however was always curious about the digital technology space. This led me to research further, from listening to tech podcasts, speaking to people in the industry, reading articles and blogs to practicing coding myself via online workshops and YouTube videos and as a result I made the decision to start a new career venture aspiring to become a full stack developer. 
          <br>I am both inspired and motivated by the women in or whom are trying to break into this predominately male dominated industry, and hope my journey encourages other females to do the same.
          <br>
          <br>With my solid soft skills, strengthening coding hard skills, eye for beauty and knack for creating more efficient processes, I aim to develop and manage aesthetically pleasing websites and applications and improve functionality. 
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>I have many interests but mainly in my spare time I love to cook and entertain, try new restaurants and bars (always up for a cheeky bev!) and keep active and outdoors.
          <br>
          <br>Connect with me below,
          <br>I look forward to working together!
