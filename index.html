       <div id="about_me_body">
        <p>Welcome!
          <br>
          <br>My name is Jamila, based in Melbourne, Australia and currently a software development student at Academy Xi. 
          <br>
          <br>I have over 8 years experience in customer service based roles across the corporate and retail industries, however was always curious about the digital technology space. This led me to research further, from listening to tech podcasts, speaking to people in the industry, reading articles and blogs to practicing coding myself via workshops and youtube videos and as a result I then made the decision to start a new career venture aspiring to become a full stack developer.
          <br>
          <br>With my solid soft skills and strengthening hard skills in coding, I aim to create and manage aesthetically pleasing and efficient functional websites and applications. 
          <br>
          <br>I am inspired by the women in this heavily male dominated industry or are trying to break in, and hope my journey encourages other females to do the same.
